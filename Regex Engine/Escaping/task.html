<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Since <code>^</code>, <code>$</code>, <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>+</code> and <code>.</code> are now reserved as metacharacters, they cannot be used as literals. This might be a problem, for example, when you want to match the end of sentences. In this case, you would look for words that are succeeded by a period or a question mark. Since these characters have a special meaning in the regex notation, they would not get matched the way you want it.<br>
    To solve this problem, the regex notation has a so called escape sequence: if a metacharacter is preceded by a backward slash (<code>\</code>), it is considered as a normal literal and can be matched.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Just like it was with the metacharacters, some more conditions should be added to the recursive function to handle the escape symbols.</p>

<p>The semantics of the backward slash is really simple: the character that follows it should be interpreted as a literal. This way, a simple string comparison is enough to determine a match. You should also take care of skipping the escape sequence before continuing the recursion. This can be done using the same logic that we used to handle the repetition operators <code>?</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>+</code>.</p>

<p>There is also a technical fact you should keep in mind: the <code>\</code> symbol is an escape sequence not only in the regex notation but also in strings. This means that typing <code>\</code> opens a string escape sequence that can be followed by some specific command of the programming language. For example, <code>\n</code> signifies a new line, like <code>Enter</code>. Strangely enough, to get a literal <code>\</code> in most programming languages, you should repeat the backslash twice, like this: <code>\\</code>. For example, a literal period for the regex engine looks like this <code>\\.</code>, a question mark looks like this <code>\\?</code>, and an asterisk looks like this <code>\\*</code>.</p>

<p>Here is another riddle. If the backward slash <code>\</code> is now an escape sequence, how can it be matched as a literal in a string? What if you want to find every string that ends with the character <code>\</code>? Check out the examples below to see what the engine does in this case.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Input:      '\.$|end.'              Output: true
Input:     '3\+3|3+3=6'             Output: true
Input:       '\?|Is this working?'  Output: true
Input:       '\\|\'                 Output: true
Input: 'colou\?r|color'             Output: false
Input: 'colou\?r|colour'            Output: false</code></pre>
