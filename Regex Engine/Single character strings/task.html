<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this first stage,&nbsp;create a function that can compare a single character regex to a single character input string.</p>

<p>The reason we are only considering single characters, for now, is the presence of the wild card&nbsp;indicated&nbsp;by a period&nbsp;(<code>.</code>). Its role in a regular expression is to match any&nbsp;character in the target string. So, if the regex that we pass to our function as an argument is a wild-card, the function always returns <code>true</code>&nbsp;no matter what it is being&nbsp;compared to.</p>

<p>When working on this stage, keep in mind the following special rules of the regex syntax:</p>

<ul>
	<li>An empty regex should always return the <code>bool</code> value&nbsp;<code>true</code>.</li>
	<li>An empty input string should always return the <code>bool</code> value&nbsp;<code>false</code>, except if the regex is also empty.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An empty regex against an empty string always returns <code>true</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These rules seem random at first, but later on, they will make sense to you.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>In this stage, your program&nbsp;should:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Accept&nbsp;two characters,&nbsp;a <code>regex</code> and an <code>input</code>;</li>
	<li>Compare the&nbsp;<code>regex</code> to the&nbsp;<code>input</code> and return a boolean&nbsp;indicating if there&#39;s a match;</li>
	<li>Support <code>.</code>&nbsp;as a wild card character that matches any input;</li>
	<li>Follow the special syntax rules outlined above.</li>
</ul>

<p>[ALERT-warning]We kindly ask you not to use the <code>regexp</code>&nbsp;package for completing this project. Otherwise, you will learn nothing from it.[/ALERT]</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<pre>
<code class="language-no-highlight">Input: 'a|a'    Â Output: true
Input: '.|a'     Output: true
Input:  '|a'     Output: true
Input:  '|'      Output: true
Input: 'a|'      Output: false
</code></pre>

<p>Note that it is purely for technical reasons that&nbsp;the input is a single string divided by the symbol&nbsp;<code>|</code>.</p>

<p>On the left of the delimiter <code>|</code> you will find the regular expression, and on the right is&nbsp;the string that is being compared to that&nbsp;regular expression. The absence of an&nbsp;input character before or after the delimiter indicates that an empty string is passed as an argument. So, if the input is&nbsp;<code>&#39;a|&#39;</code>, you should pass <code>&#39;a&#39;</code> as a regular expression and <code>&#39;&#39;</code> as an input string to the function.</p>

<p>For valid testing, the results should be printed to the command line. This can be achieved by putting the return value of the function into the <code>fmt.Println()</code> function, which automatically casts the <code>bool</code> result into a <code>string</code>. You should do this at the end of every stage.</p>

<p><strong>Hint</strong>: There are multiple ways to tell&nbsp;if a string is empty. For example, you can use the fact that the length of an empty string is always zero. You may also&nbsp;compare the input string to an empty string literal&nbsp;represented by empty&nbsp;quotation marks (<code>&#39;&#39;</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>&quot;&quot;</code>).&nbsp;Finally, you can use the&nbsp;boolean logic to determine whether&nbsp;a string is empty.</p>
